## Moonbase Defender

An open-source tower defence game made using Phaser 3

This is simply the github repository for this project if you're interested in how it works, the actual playable game can be found here. **TODO: add link**

# Under Construction
If you have any ideas of how I can make this game better, or if there's anything you might want to see in a future release, please don't hesitate to open an issue, and I'll try my best to make any improvements. I'm also going to continue working on this game, so keep an eye out!
